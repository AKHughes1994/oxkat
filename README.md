A lightweight set of scripts for processing MeerKAT data.

"Ceci n'est pas une pipe[line]" (_The Treachery of Images_, Ren√© Magritte, 1929)

---

Example for usage on the IDIA slurm cluster:

1. Log in to the slurm head node:

```
$ ssh ianh@slurm.ilifu.ac.za
```

2. Clone this repo somewhere:

```
$ cd ~/Software
$ git clone https://github.com/IanHeywood/oxkat.git
```

3. Go to a scratch data area:

```
$ cd /scratch/users/ianh/XMM12
```

4. Make a symlink to the scripts and the data you want to process:

```
$ ln -s ~/Software/oxkat/* .
$ ln -s /idia/projects/mightee/1538856059/1538856059_sdp_l0.full_1284.full_pol.ms .
```

5. Set up and submit the 1GC jobs:

```
$ python setups/1GC_slurm.py
$ source submit_1GC_jobs.sh
```

6. If something goes wrong you can subsequently kill the jobs using:

```
$ source kill_1GC_jobs.sh
```

7. If that completes successfully you can set up and submit the 2GC jobs, which does imaging with an iteration of phase-only self-cal:

```
$ python waterhole/2GC_slurm_CASA-selfcal.py
$ source submit_2GC_jobs.sh
```

8. Again, you can kill the 2GC jobs using:

```
$ source kill_2GC_jobs.sh
```

Notes:

* You might not have permission to use the containers that I store in my home area, in which case you'll have to pull your own. [@SpheMakh](https://github.com/sphemakh)'s [stimela](https://hub.docker.com/u/stimela) repo is a life saver here. You can build the usual suspects with [`tools/pull_containers.sh`](https://github.com/IanHeywood/oxkat/blob/master/tools/pull_containers.sh), and then you'll just have to edit [line 26](https://github.com/IanHeywood/oxkat/blob/master/oxkat/generate_jobs.py#L26) in [`oxkat/generate_jobs.py`](https://github.com/IanHeywood/oxkat/blob/master/oxkat/generate_jobs.py) to reflect wherever it is you've built them.

* Direction-dependent calibration is not yet automated.

* Joint imaging and self-calibration of multiple epochs is not yet automated.

* This repo is just a place for me to keep my scripts. I hope you find it useful but please don't mail me if your data vanishes or your computer melts. 

* Please file bugs, questions, comments as issues on this page.

Thanks.
